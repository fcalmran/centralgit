print(l5.count(60))
print(l5.sort()) # Shows None Why?
l5.sort()
print(l5)
# Why this ?? Reason?

# The reason print(l5.sort()) shows None is because the sort() method in Python sorts the list in place and does not return a new list. 
# Instead, it modifies the original list directly and returns None.

# Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:

# l5.sort() sorts the list but does not return anything. It modifies l5 directly and the return value is None.
# When you try to print l5.sort(), Python prints the return value of l5.sort(), which is None, instead of the sorted list.
# To see the sorted list, you can call l5.sort() first to sort the list, and then print l5 separately:


print(max(l5))
print(min(l5))

# Same case goes with reverse, if put the print embeded with reverse function it will give None.
print(l5.reverse())
# to print it correctly we do the same method as we did in sort() function. logic is same

l5.reverse()
print(l5)

l6=["Hello","World"]
l6.reverse()
print(l6)

# Using Index Function
print(l6)
print(l6.index("Hello"))

# We can print in other way too like using variable
a=l6.index("Hello")
print(a)

# Finding the index of the item which is not exists
print(l6.index("Fun")) # Gives an error because the item doesn't exists in the list l6
